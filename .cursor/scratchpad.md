# Clara Engine Project Status

## Background and Motivation
Clara Engine is a multi-tenant AI bot platform enabling deployment of personalized GPT-powered Twitter bots for multiple clients from a single, centralized codebase. The system needs to be robust, scalable, and maintainable.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

### Completed Features âœ…
1. Project Structure and Setup
   - Basic project structure established
   - Development environment configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Pre-commit hooks and code quality tools
   - Documentation templates

2. Database Integration
   - Supabase integration complete
   - Initial schema migrations
   - Database client implementation
   - CRUD operations for clients and tweets
   - Row-level security policies

3. OpenAI Integration Core Components
   - OpenAIClient implementation with Azure support
   - Prompt management system
   - Response validation with safety checks
   - Semantic caching system
   - Comprehensive test coverage

### In Progress ðŸš€
1. OpenAI Integration (Final Touches)
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Cost monitoring system
   - A/B testing capability for prompts

2. Twitter Integration
   - Not started
   - Blocked by Twitter API access setup

### Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹
1. Main Engine Loop
   - Scheduler implementation
   - Multi-client coordination
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Monitoring and alerting

2. Deployment Infrastructure
   - Container setup
   - Production environment configuration
   - Monitoring implementation
   - Backup and recovery procedures

3. Client Configuration System
   - Client onboarding flow
   - Configuration validation
   - Security implementation
   - Rate limiting per client

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Twitter API Integration
   - Need to obtain Twitter Developer Account access
   - Define required permission scopes
   - Implement rate limiting and error handling

2. Production Readiness
   - Need to implement comprehensive monitoring
   - Set up alerting for critical failures
   - Define backup and recovery procedures
   - Document deployment process

3. Security Considerations
   - API key management in production
   - Client data isolation
   - Rate limiting and quota management
   - Audit logging

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Complete OpenAI Integration
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting
   - [ ] Add cost monitoring
   - [ ] Set up A/B testing framework
   - Success Criteria: All OpenAI-related tests passing, rate limits respected

2. Twitter Integration
   - [ ] Set up Twitter Developer Account
   - [ ] Implement Twitter client
   - [ ] Add tweet posting functionality
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting
   - Success Criteria: Successful tweet posting with proper error handling

3. Main Engine Loop
   - [ ] Design scheduler system
   - [ ] Implement client coordination
   - [ ] Add monitoring and metrics
   - [ ] Create recovery procedures
   - Success Criteria: Engine running continuously without manual intervention

4. Production Setup
   - [ ] Create Docker configuration
   - [ ] Set up monitoring stack
   - [ ] Configure backup system
   - [ ] Document deployment process
   - Success Criteria: Successful deployment with monitoring

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Need Twitter Developer Account credentials to proceed with Twitter integration
- Need to define specific rate limiting requirements per client
- Need to establish monitoring requirements and alerting thresholds

## Lessons
1. Always include info useful for debugging in the program output
2. Read files before editing them
3. Run npm audit before proceeding with dependency updates
4. Always ask before using the -force git command
5. Ensure proper error handling and logging in all API integrations

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining OpenAI integration features
2. Obtain Twitter API access and begin integration
3. Design and implement the main engine loop
4. Set up production infrastructure

## Questions for Stakeholders
1. What are the expected rate limits per client?
2. What monitoring metrics are most critical?
3. What is the expected scale for the initial deployment?
4. What are the recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)?
